        <p>This guide addresses your rights when stopped, questioned, arrested, or searched by law enforcement officers in South Carolina. It applies to both citizens and non-citizens, with additional information for non-citizens.</p>
        <p>This guide provides information about your basic rights and is not a substitute for legal advice. You should contact an attorney if you have been arrested or believe your rights have been violated.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <h4>At the Outset, Remember</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay calm.</strong> Do not run, argue, or physically resist.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep your hands visible.</strong> Do not make sudden movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not obstruct the officer.</strong> You can assert your rights without interfering.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not lie or provide false documents.</strong> This can result in additional charges.</li>
            <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down officer names, badge numbers, and details after the encounter.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not rely on lawsuits.</strong> Lawsuits are costly, time-consuming, and often unsuccessful. Focus on protecting yourself in the moment.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Types of Police Encounters</h3>
        <p>Not all police encounters are the same. Understanding the difference is critical to knowing your rights:</p>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">Consensual Encounter</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>A voluntary conversation where you are free to leave at any time. No suspicion is required. You have no obligation to answer questions or stay. Simply ask: <strong>"Am I free to go?"</strong> If yes, you may leave.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">Detention (Terry Stop)</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>A brief, involuntary stop requiring reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. You are not free to leave, but you are not under arrest. You still have the right to remain silent.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">Arrest</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>Formal custody requiring probable cause or a warrant. You are not free to leave. Miranda rights apply during custodial interrogation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Body-Worn Cameras &amp; Public Records</h3>
        <p>Many South Carolina law enforcement officers now wear body-worn cameras. If you are involved in an encounter, you can request body camera footage through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the relevant law enforcement agency. Note that some footage may be redacted or withheld for ongoing investigations. Having your own recording is still important.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <h4>Local Ordinances Vary</h4>
          <p>Local ordinances can vary significantly across South Carolina cities and counties. Rules about loitering, noise, curfews, open containers, panhandling, and other activities may differ from one municipality to another. What is legal in one area may be prohibited in another. When in doubt, research local ordinances or consult with an attorney familiar with laws in your specific area.</p>

          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>South Carolina is <strong>NOT</strong> a "stop and identify" state. You are not legally required to identify yourself to police during a routine stop. You have the right to remain silent and can politely decline to answer questions.</p>
            <p>However, providing identification <strong>IS</strong> required when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You are operating a motor vehicle (driver's license, registration, insurance)</li>
              <li>You have been lawfully arrested</li>
              <li>A specific statute applies (e.g., certain regulated activities like purchasing alcohol or firearms)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If an officer approaches you, you can ask: <strong>"Am I free to go?"</strong> If yes, calmly walk away. If no, you are being detained.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">What if I am detained?</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>Being detained is not the same as being arrested. You may still be released after brief questioning.</p>
            <h4>Pat-Downs</h4>
            <p>Police can only pat down the outside of your clothing if they have reasonable suspicion you are armed and dangerous. They cannot reach into pockets unless they feel something that could be a weapon. Say clearly: <strong>"I do not consent to a search."</strong> If they search anyway, do not physically resist.</p>
            <h4>Questions and Identification</h4>
            <p>You are not required to answer questions. However, it is generally best practice to provide your name and ID if requested. If you do not want to answer additional questions, say: <strong>"I do not want to speak without a lawyer present."</strong></p>
            <h4>"Match the Description"</h4>
            <p>If officers say you match the description of a suspect, ask: <strong>"Am I free to go?"</strong> If no, you are being detained. Follow the above directions.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">How long can I be detained?</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>There is no fixed time limit. A stop may last as long as reasonably necessary to complete its purpose. However, officers cannot unreasonably prolong a stop beyond its original purpose without developing new reasonable suspicion.</p>

        <div class="qa-item">
          <div class="qa-question">Can I record the encounter?</div>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> South Carolina is a one-party consent state. You have the legal right to record police officers performing their duties in public spaces. However:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not interfere with police activity</li>
              <li>Maintain a safe distance</li>
              <li>Hold your phone/camera openly, not concealed</li>
              <li>Police cannot confiscate or view your photos/videos without a warrant</li>
              <li>Police may NOT delete your recordings under any circumstances</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If ordered to stop recording, you can politely refuse\u2014but be aware some officers may not know this is your right.</p>
            <p><strong>Body-worn cameras:</strong> Many officers wear body cameras. You can request this footage through a FOIA request after the encounter.</p>

            <p>If you have a concealed weapons permit (CWP) in South Carolina, you must carry your permit with you. If an officer asks to see it, you are required to provide it. It is advisable to inform the officer that you have a weapon in the vehicle.</p>

        <h3>Your Miranda Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are taken into custody and interrogated, officers must inform you of your Miranda rights before questioning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent</li>
          <li>Anything you say can and will be used against you in court</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-critical">
          <h4>Miranda vs. Salinas Distinction</h4>
          <p>Miranda rights only apply during <strong>custodial interrogation</strong> (when you are not free to leave). However, under <em>Salinas v. Texas</em> (2013), during non-custodial questioning (voluntary conversations), <strong>your silence can be used against you</strong> unless you affirmatively invoke your Fifth Amendment rights by saying: <strong>"I am exercising my right to remain silent."</strong></p>
          <p>Officers can ask basic booking questions without reading your rights. For DUI arrests in South Carolina, Miranda warnings must be given on video (S.C. Code \u00A756-5-2953).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Right to Know the Reason</h3>
        <p>Under South Carolina law (S.C. Code \u00A717-13-50), if police take you into custody, they must tell you the reason why. It is unlawful for an officer to refuse to answer when you ask why you are being detained, or to refuse to state a lawful basis for the detention.</p>

        <h3>What should I do if arrested?</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled (<em>Salinas v. Texas</em>, 2013) that you must <strong>verbally invoke</strong> your right to remain silent. Simply staying quiet may not be enough. Say these words clearly and repeat to every officer:</p>
        <ul class="key-phrases">
          <li>I invoke my privilege against self-incrimination.</li>
          <li>I am exercising my right to remain silent.</li>

        <p>In South Carolina, juveniles (persons under 17, or under 18 for some purposes) have the same constitutional rights as adults (<em>In re Gault</em>, 1967). However, there are some special procedures.</p>

        <h3>"Taken into Custody" vs. "Arrest"</h3>
        <p>South Carolina uses the term "taken into custody" instead of "arrest" for juveniles. Unlike adults, juveniles are not served with arrest warrants. Instead, a "petition" is filed in family court alleging the juvenile committed an offense.</p>

        <h3>Notification Requirements</h3>
        <p>If you are under 18 and taken into custody:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Police must inform your parent, guardian, or custodian as soon as possible</li>
          <li>If not released to a responsible adult, the Department of Juvenile Justice must be notified and respond within one hour</li>
          <li>If charged with an offense that would be a misdemeanor or felony for an adult, your school principal will also be informed</li>
          <li>If not released, a court hearing must be held within 48 hours (not counting weekends or holidays)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Right to a Lawyer</h3>
        <p>You have the right to a lawyer at your hearing. The court will appoint one if you cannot afford one. A family court judge will typically require that you at least speak with a lawyer before deciding you don't want one.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-critical">
          <h4>Confessions</h4>
          <p>Even as a juvenile, you are considered capable of making a voluntary confession. If you waive your Miranda rights and make a statement, it can be used against you in court\u2014even without your lawyer present. <strong>It is strongly advised NOT to speak to police before meeting with a lawyer.</strong></p>

          <h4>This Is Legal</h4>
          <p>Police officers are legally permitted to lie to you during an investigation. The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed police to use deception, including falsely claiming that a co-defendant confessed or that they have evidence (like fingerprints or DNA) when they do not.</p>
        </div>

        <ul>

          <li>Evidence they claim to have</li>
          <li>What witnesses or co-defendants have said</li>
          <li>Making emotional appeals to get you to talk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>However, police are NOT allowed to:</h3>
        <p>Refuse to tell you why you have been taken into custody, or lie about the reason for your detention.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <h4>Remember</h4>
          <p>If you say something that incriminates yourself, it can be used against you in court\u2014even if the police lied to get you to say it. When in doubt, remain silent and ask for a lawyer.</p>

        <h3>Filing a Complaint Against Law Enforcement</h3>
        <p>There are multiple avenues for filing complaints against law enforcement officers in South Carolina. You may file complaints with more than one agency.</p>

        <h4>Step 1: File with the Local Agency's Internal Affairs Division</h4>
        <p>Every law enforcement agency has an internal affairs or professional standards unit. Contact the police department or sheriff's office where the officer works and ask to file a complaint with their internal affairs division. You can usually file:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In person at the agency headquarters</li>
          <li>By phone</li>
          <li>In writing by mail</li>
          <li>Online (many agencies have complaint forms on their websites)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step 2: Escalate to the County Sheriff</h4>
        <p>If you are dissatisfied with the response from a local police department, you may escalate your complaint to the county sheriff's office.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Contact SLED (State Law Enforcement Division)</h4>
        <p>SLED may investigate a law enforcement agency depending on the nature of the complaint. SLED investigates all officer-involved shootings statewide.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phone: (803) 737-9000</li>
          <li>Website: <a href="https://www.sled.sc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.sled.sc.gov</a></li>
          <li>Mail: SLED Office of Professional Responsibility, P.O. Box 21398, Columbia, SC 29221</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Officer Decertification</h4>
        <p>The SC Criminal Justice Academy and Law Enforcement Training Council can revoke an officer's certification for misconduct. While misconduct reports must be filed by law enforcement agencies, your complaint to the local agency can trigger this process. Serious misconduct can result in permanent decertification.</p>

        <h4>Federal Civil Rights Complaints</h4>
        <p>If you believe your civil rights were violated, you can file a complaint with federal authorities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. Attorney's Office, District of South Carolina</strong><br>Attn: Civil Rights Program<br>1441 Main Street, Suite 500<br>Columbia, SC 29201<br>Phone: (803) 929-3000</li>
          <li><strong>U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 Civil Rights Division</strong><br>950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW<br>Washington, D.C. 20530-0001<br>Website: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.justice.gov/crt</a></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <h4>Improper Searches</h4>
          <p>You may be able to challenge an improper search if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Police searched or seized your body, home, papers, or belongings</li>
            <li>You had a reasonable expectation of privacy in what was searched</li>
            <li>It was YOUR rights that were violated (not someone else's)</li>
            <li>The police did not have a proper warrant or valid exception</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your attorney may be able to file a motion to suppress evidence obtained through an illegal search. Contact a lawyer to discuss your options.</p>

        <h3>Law enforcement asks about my immigration status</h3>

        <h4>How to reduce risk to yourself</h4>
        <ul>

          <li>Don\u2019t lie about your status or provide false documents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent and do not have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police, immigration agents, or other officials. Anything you tell an officer can later be used against you in immigration court.</li>
          <li>If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you.</li>
          <li>If an immigration agent asks if they can search you, you have the right to say no. Agents do not have the right to search you or your belongings without your consent or probable cause.</li>
          <li>If you\u2019re over 18, carry your papers with you at all times. If you don\u2019t have them, tell the officer that you want to remain silent, or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering any questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do in such an encounter</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In some states, you must provide your name to law enforcement if you are stopped and told to identify yourself. But even if you give your name, you don\u2019t have to answer other questions.</li>
          <li>If you are driving and are pulled over, the officer can require you to show your license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance, but you don\u2019t have to answer questions about your immigration status.</li>
          <li>Customs officers can ask about your immigration status when entering or leaving the country. If you are a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who has maintained your status, you only have to answer questions establishing your identity and permanent residency. Refusal to answer other questions will likely cause delay, but officials may not deny you entry into the United States for failure to answer other questions. If you are a non-citizen visa holder, you may be denied entry into the U.S. if you refuse to answer officers\u2019 questions.</li>

        <h3>I\u2019ve been stopped by police or ICE</h3>

        <h4>How to reduce risk to yourself</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay calm and do not resist or obstruct the agents or officers.</li>
          <li>Do not lie or give false documents.</li>
          <li>Prepare yourself and your family in case you are arrested. Memorize the phone numbers of your family and your lawyer. Make emergency plans if you have children or take medication.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent. If you wish to exercise that right, say so out loud. (In some states, you may be required to provide your name if asked to identify yourself.)</li>
          <li>You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings, but police may pat down your clothing if they suspect a weapon.</li>
          <li>If you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer.</li>
          <li>If you are detained by ICE, you have the right to consult with a lawyer, but the government is not required to provide one for you. You can ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives.</li>
          <li>You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules apply at international borders and airports, and for individuals on certain nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do if you are arrested or detained</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don\u2019t give any explanations or excuses. Don\u2019t say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer.</li>
          <li>If you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer.</li>
          <li>If you have been detained by ICE, you have the right to contact your consulate or have an officer inform the consulate of your detention.</li>
          <li>Remember your immigration number (\u201CA\u201D number) and give it to your family. It will help family members locate you.</li>
          <li>Keep a copy of your immigration documents with someone you trust.</li>
          <li><strong>If you are a non-citizen:</strong> Ask your lawyer about the effect of a criminal conviction or plea on your immigration status. Don\u2019t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer. While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Do not answer questions or sign anything before talking to a lawyer. Read all papers fully. If you do not understand or cannot read the papers, tell the officer you need an interpreter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If you believe your rights were violated</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Write down everything you remember, including officers\u2019 badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses.</li>
          <li>If you\u2019re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.</li>
          <li>File a written complaint with the agency\u2019s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously if you wish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Police or ICE are at my home</h3>

        <h4>How to reduce risk to yourself</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay calm and keep the door closed. Opening the door does not give them permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent, even if officer has a warrant.</li>
          <li>You do not have to let police or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain kinds of warrants.</li>
          <li>If police have an arrest warrant, they are legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside. But a warrant of removal/deportation (Form I-205) does not allow officers to enter a home without consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do when the police or ICE arrive</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.</li>
          <li>Ask the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.</li>
          <li>Ask if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.</li>
          <li>Don\u2019t lie or produce any false documents. Don\u2019t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.</li>
          <li>Do not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address. If they don\u2019t produce a warrant, keep the door closed. State: \u201CI do not consent to your entry.\u201D</li>
          <li>If agents force their way in, do not resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: \u201CI do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.\u201D</li>
          <li>If you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I need a lawyer</h3>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are arrested by the police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer, and should ask for one immediately.</li>
          <li>If arrested, you have the right to a private phone call within a reasonable time of your arrest, and police may not listen to the call if it is made to a lawyer.</li>
          <li>If you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you have the right to hire a lawyer, but the government does not have to provide one for you. Ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives.</li>
          <li>If you are detained, you have the right to call a lawyer or your family, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer in detention. You have the right to have your attorney with you at any hearing before an immigration judge.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Here is a list of contact information for legal organizations that assist immigrants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I\u2019ve been detained near the border by Border Patrol</h3>

        <h4>How to reduce risk to yourself</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay calm when interacting with immigration officials. Do not lie or provide false documents.</li>
          <li>Never flee from an immigration checkpoint.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to remain silent. You can also tell the agent that you\u2019ll only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status.</li>
          <li>You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. A limited exception exists for people who have permission to be in the U.S. for a specific reason and for a limited amount of time (a \u201Cnonimmigrant\u201D on a visa, for example). These individuals are required to provide information about their immigration status if asked.</li>
          <li>Generally, a Border Patrol agent cannot detain you unless they have \u201Creasonable suspicion\u201D that you are committing or committed a violation of immigration law or federal law.</li>
          <li>An immigration officer cannot arrest you without \u201Cprobable cause.\u201D That means the agent must have facts about you that make it probable that you are committing, or committed, a violation of immigration law or federal law.</li>
          <li>At immigration checkpoints, agents do not need any suspicion to stop you and ask you questions, but their questions should be brief and related to verifying immigration status. They can also visually inspect your vehicle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to expect</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>People who have entered the U.S. without inspection by an immigration official may be subject to expedited removal from the U.S. based on certain criteria. If you are told that you are subject to expedited removal, ask for the stated reason. Also, if you fear persecution if returned to your country of origin, you should immediately inform the agents of your fear.</li>
          <li>At border crossings, federal authorities do not need a warrant or even suspicion of wrongdoing to justify conducting what courts have called a \u201Croutine search,\u201D such as searching luggage or a vehicle.</li>
          <li>If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. U.S. citizens do not have to carry proof of citizenship if they are in the U.S. If you have valid immigration documents and are over the age of 18, the law requires that you carry those documents with you. If you are asked by an immigration agent to produce them, show them to the agent. If you are an immigrant without documents, you can decline the officer\u2019s request, although an agent may then ask you more questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I was stopped by police, ICE, or Border Patrol while in transit</h3>

        <h4>How to reduce risk to yourself</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay calm. Don\u2019t run, argue, or obstruct the officer or agent. Keep your hands raised where they can see them.</li>
          <li>If you are in a car, pull over in a safe place as quickly as possible. Turn off the engine, turn on the internal light, open the window part way and place your hands on the wheel. Upon request, show police your driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance.</li>
          <li>If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your papers, you must show them if you have them with you. If you are over 18, carry your immigration documents with you at all times. If you do not have immigration papers, say you want to remain silent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <p><strong>In a car:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drivers and passengers have the right to remain silent. If you are a passenger, you can ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly leave.</li>
          <li>If an officer or immigration agent asks to look inside your car, you can refuse to consent to the search. But if police generally believe that your car contains evidence of a crime, your car can be searched without your consent.</li>
          <li>In addition to police, Border Patrol conduct \u201Croving patrols\u201D around the interior of the U.S., pulling over motorists. Border Patrol must have reasonable suspicion that the driver or passengers in the car committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.</li>
          <li>Any arrest or prolonged stop by Border Patrol requires probable cause. You may ask the agents about the basis for probable cause, and they should tell you. In this situation, both the driver and any passengers have the right to remain silent and not answer questions about their immigration status.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>On an airplane:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pilot may refuse to fly a passenger if he or she reasonably believes that the passenger is a threat to flight safety. A pilot may not, however, question you or refuse to allow you on a flight because of bias based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.</li>
          <li>If you believe you are mistakenly on a \u201Cno-fly\u201D list, you should review the ACLU\u2019s guidance on No-Fly lists.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>On buses and trains:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Border Patrol agents may board buses and trains in the 100-mile border region either at the station or while the bus is on its journey. More than one officer usually boards the bus, and they will ask passengers questions about their immigration status, ask passengers to show them immigration documents, or both.</li>
          <li>These questions should be brief and related to verifying one\u2019s lawful presence in the U.S. You are not required to answer and can simply say you do not wish to do so. As always, you have the right to remain silent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If you believe your rights were violated</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Write down everything you remember, including officers\u2019 badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information from witnesses.</li>
          <li>If you\u2019re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.</li>
          <li>File a written complaint with the agency\u2019s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously.</li>

        <h3>I am detained while my immigration case is underway</h3>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Most people who are detained while their case is underway are eligible to be released on bond or with other reporting conditions.</li>
          <li>You have the right to call a lawyer or your family if you are detained, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer in detention.</li>
          <li>You have the right to have your attorney with you at any hearing before an immigration judge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do if you are detained</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are denied release after being arrested for an immigration violation, ask for a bond hearing before an immigration judge. In many cases, an immigration judge can order that you be released or that your bond be lowered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I\u2019ve been arrested and need to challenge a deportation order</h3>

        <h4>Your rights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to a hearing to challenge a deportation order, unless you waive your right to a hearing, sign something called a \u201CStipulated Removal Order,\u201D or take \u201Cvoluntary departure.\u201D</li>
          <li>You have the right to an attorney, but the government does not have to provide one for you. Ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives. If you have no lawyer, ask the court to allow you time to find one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What to do if you are arrested</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are told that you do not have the right to see an immigration judge, you should speak with a lawyer immediately. There are some cases in which a person might not have a right to see an immigration judge. But even if you are told that is your situation, you should ask to speak to a lawyer immediately because Immigration officers will not always know or tell you about exceptions that might apply to you.</li>
          <li>If you fear persecution or torture in your home country, tell an officer and contact a lawyer immediately. You have additional rights if you have this fear.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Si un agente de inmigraci\u00f3n pregunta si pueden registrarlo, usted tiene el derecho a decir que no. Los agentes no tienen el derecho a registrarlo o a registrar sus cosas sin obtener su consentimiento o sin tener una causa probable. Esto significa que el agente debe poseer hechos sobre usted que hagan probable que est\u00e9 cometiendo o haya cometido una violaci\u00f3n de la ley migratoria o federal.</li>
          <li>Si es mayor de 18 a\u00f1os, lleve sus documentos de inmigraci\u00f3n v\u00e1lidos consigo en todo momento. Si no tiene documentos de inmigraci\u00f3n v\u00e1lidos, tiene el derecho a permanecer callado y a pedir hablar con un abogado/a antes de responder a cualquier pregunta.</li>

          <li>Si est\u00e1 manejando y lo paran, el oficial puede requerir que ense\u00f1e su licencia de conducir, registro y prueba de seguro, sin embargo, no necesita responder a preguntas sobre su estatus migratorio.</li>

          <li>Si no est\u00e1 seguro, pida tiempo para llamar a un abogado.</li>
          <li>No abra la puerta a menos que ICE le muestre una orden judicial de registro o una orden de arresto que nombre a una persona en su residencia y / o especifique el \u00e1rea autorizada a ser registrada en su direcci\u00f3n.</li>

          <li>No mienta ni produzca ning\u00fan documento falso. No firme ning\u00fan documento sin hablar primero con un abogado/a.</li>
          <li>Si ICE busca a un ser querido, no mienta sobre su paradero. Puede decir: \u201cNo quiero contestar ninguna pregunta,\u201d y puede pedir a los agentes que dejen sus datos de contacto. No es requerido decirles c\u00f3mo pueden localizar a la persona que buscan.</li>
          <li>Solicite un int\u00e9rprete si el ingl\u00e9s no es el idioma con el que se siente m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo.</li>

        <h4>C\u00f3mo reducir el riesgo para usted mismo</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Mantenga la calma cuando interact\u00fae con oficiales de inmigraci\u00f3n. No mienta ni provea documentos falsos.</li>
          <li>Nunca huya de un puesto de control migratorio.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sus derechos</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tiene el derecho a permanecer callado. Tambi\u00e9n puede decirle al agente que solo responder\u00e1 a preguntas en presencia de un abogado/a, sin importar su ciudadan\u00eda o su estatus migratorio.</li>
          <li>No es requerido que conteste preguntas acerca de su estatus migratorio. Una excepci\u00f3n limitada existe para las personas que tienen permiso de estar en los EE.UU. por una raz\u00f3n especial y por un periodo limitado de tiempo (por ejemplo, una persona \u201cno inmigrante\u201d con una visa). Dichas personas deben proveer informaci\u00f3n sobre su estatus migratorio si se les pregunta.</li>
          <li>Por lo general, un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza no puede detenerlo/la a menos que tenga una \u201csospecha razonable\u201d de que est\u00e9 cometiendo o haya cometido una violaci\u00f3n de la ley migratoria o federal.</li>
          <li>Un agente de inmigraci\u00f3n no puede arrestarlo/la sin \u201ccausa probable.\u201d Esto significa que el agente debe poseer hechos sobre usted que hagan probable que est\u00e9 cometiendo o haya cometido una violaci\u00f3n de la ley migratoria o federal.</li>
          <li>En puestos de control migratorio, los agentes no necesitan ninguna sospecha para detenerlo/la y hacerle preguntas, pero sus preguntas deben ser breves y relacionadas a verificar su estatus migratorio. Tambi\u00e9n pueden inspeccionar visualmente su veh\u00edculo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Qu\u00e9 esperar</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Las personas que hayan entrado a los EE.UU. sin ser inspeccionados por un oficial de inmigraci\u00f3n pueden estar sujetas a deportaciones aceleradas conforme a ciertos criterios. Si teme a una persecuci\u00f3n de ser regresado a su pa\u00eds de origen, debe informarle inmediatamente a los agentes de inmigraci\u00f3n de su miedo.</li>
          <li>En controles fronterizos, las autoridades federales no necesitan una orden judicial ni siquiera una sospecha de un delito para llevar a cabo lo que las cortes han llamado una \u201crevisi\u00f3n rutinaria,\u201d como registrar equipaje o un veh\u00edculo.</li>
          <li>Si un agente le pide documentos, lo que necesita proporcionar difiere dependiendo de su estatus migratorio. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses no tienen que llevar pruebas de ciudadan\u00eda si est\u00e1n dentro de los EE.UU. Si usted no es ciudadano y tiene documentos migratorios v\u00e1lidos y es mayor de los 18 a\u00f1os de edad, la ley requiere que usted lleve esos documentos consigo. Si un agente de inmigraci\u00f3n le pide que se los muestre, debe ense\u00f1\u00e1rselos. Si usted es una persona inmigrante sin documentos, puede rehusar la petici\u00f3n del agente, aunque el agente podr\u00eda entonces hacerle m\u00e1s preguntas.</li>

          <li>Si un polic\u00eda o agente de inmigraci\u00f3n pide revisar el interior de su auto, usted puede negarse a la revisi\u00f3n. Pero si la polic\u00eda cree que su auto contiene evidencia de un crimen, su auto puede ser registrado sin su consentimiento.</li>
          <li>La polic\u00eda puede ordenarle a usted y a sus pasajeros a que salgan del veh\u00edculo por seguridad. Obedezca y salga tranquilamente si se lo piden.</li>
          <li>Adem\u00e1s de la polic\u00eda, la Oficina de Aduanas y Protecci\u00f3n Fronteriza (CBP) lleva a cabo \u201cpatrullas ambulantes\u201d en el interior de los EE.UU. parando a motoristas. CBP debe tener una sospecha razonable que el conductor o los pasajeros en el carro han cometido una violaci\u00f3n migratoria o un crimen federal.</li>
          <li>Cualquier arresto o detenci\u00f3n prolongada por parte de CBP requiere que el agente tenga causa probable. Esto significa que el agente debe poseer hechos sobre usted que hagan probable que est\u00e9 cometiendo o haya cometido una violaci\u00f3n de la ley migratoria o federal. Usted puede preguntarle a los agentes en qu\u00e9 basan su causa probable y deben dec\u00edrselo. En esta situaci\u00f3n, tanto el conductor como los pasajeros tienen el derecho a permanecer callados y no contestar preguntas sobre sus estatus migratorio.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>En un avi\u00f3n:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Un piloto puede negarse a transportar a un pasajero si el piloto cree de forma razonable que el pasajero es una amenaza para la seguridad del vuelo. Un piloto no puede, sin embargo, interrogarlo/la ni negarse a permitirlo/la a bordo del vuelo por prejuicios basados en su religi\u00f3n, raza, origen nacional, g\u00e9nero, etnicidad, o creencias pol\u00edticas.</li>
          <li>Si usted cree que est\u00e1 por error en una lista de exclusi\u00f3n a\u00e9rea, debe comunicarse con la TSA y someter una petici\u00f3n usando el Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>En autobuses y trenes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Agentes de CBP pueden abordar autobuses y trenes, en la estaci\u00f3n o durante el viaje, en los Estados Unidos en la regi\u00f3n que se encuentra dentro de 100 millas de la frontera. M\u00e1s de un agente t\u00edpicamente aborda. Los agentes hacen preguntas a los pasajeros sobre su estatus migratorio, les piden muestren sus documentos migratorios, o ambos.</li>
          <li>Estas preguntas deben ser breves y relacionadas a verificar la presencia legal del pasajero en los EE.UU. Usted no est\u00e1 obligado a responder y puede decir simplemente que no desea hacerlo. Como siempre, tiene el derecho a permanecer callado.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Si cree que sus derechos han sido violados</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Apunte todo lo que pueda recordar incluyendo los n\u00fameros de las placas de los agentes y las placas de los veh\u00edculos de patrulla, de qu\u00e9 agencia eran los oficiales y cualquier otro detalle. Obtenga informaci\u00f3n para poder contactar a personas hayan sido testigo de los hechos.</li>
          <li>Si resulta lesionado, busque atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica de inmediato y tome fotograf\u00edas de sus lesiones.</li>
          <li>Av\u00edsele a su abogado ya que esta informaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda ayudar a su caso de inmigraci\u00f3n.</li>
          <li>Presente una denuncia por escrito ante la divisi\u00f3n de asuntos internos o la junta civil que examina quejas de la agencia que haya violado sus derechos. En la mayor\u00eda de los casos, puede presentar una denuncia de forma an\u00f3nima si as\u00ed lo desea.</li>

          <li>Usted tiene el derecho a una audiencia para impugnar una orden de deportaci\u00f3n a menos que usted renuncie a su derecho a una audiencia, firme algo llamado un \u201cStipulated Removal Order,\u201d o acepte una \u201csalida voluntaria.\u201d</li>
          <li>Usted tiene derecho a un abogado/a, pero el gobierno no tiene que proveerle uno.

          <li>Si se le dice que no tiene el derecho de ver un juez de inmigraci\u00f3n, debe hablar con un abogado/a inmediatamente. Hay ciertos casos en los que una persona puede no tener el derecho a presentar su caso ante un juez de inmigraci\u00f3n. Pero aun si se le dice que esta es su situaci\u00f3n, puede pedir hablar con un abogado/a de inmediato porque los oficiales de inmigraci\u00f3n no siempre conocen o informan de las excepciones que pueden aplicar en cada caso.</li>
          <li>Si teme a una persecuci\u00f3n o tortura en su pa\u00eds de origen, d\u00edgaselo a un agente de inmigraci\u00f3n y contacte a un abogado/a inmediatamente. Tiene derechos adicionales si tiene este temor.</li>
